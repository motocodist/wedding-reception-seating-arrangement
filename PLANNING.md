# Planning Notes

This is where I write down my thoughts to help me figure out which direction I need to go in

## 6/4/2024
First things I need to do:
1. identify the basic UI/UX design of the application with a high level view of how it would look and work like
2. identify the available frontend technology options that would support the desired UI/UX features
3. identify the web server needs: hosting, domain name?

After that, I need to figure out how and where I will persist the data so that one user can access the same table 
from different clients.
