# Wedding Reception Seating Arrangement

### This is an application to be used by anyone who wants to create the seating arrangement for a wedding reception.

My intial goals for this application and for what I would consider to be the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is to have the ability to:
- choose the number of tables at the venue (circle tables only for now)
- choose the number of seats per table
- create the list of attendees (add, edit, remove)
- drag and drop the attendee(s) to a table from the list, or to the list from a table
- reset table assignments
- reset everything (table assignments and attendee list)

Other ideas I'd like to implement at some point:
- be able to choose the shape of the table (circle, square, rectangle)
- ability to toggle a Sweetheart table (will the bride and groom sit separately or with their wedding party?)
- ability to set the attendee's side (bride vs groom)
- ability to add labels to the attendees:
    - maid/matron of honor
    - best man
    - bridesmaids
    - groomsmen
    - bride's parents
    - groom's parents
